# ESP32C3 Various tests


## GPIO / Interrupt General observations:
	* Writing out to a port is a quantized operation.
	* CPU is at 160? MHz.
	* AHB quantized at 80 MHz.
	* Nonsequentail Sequential writes take 50ns (4x 80 MHz cycles).
	* Sequential writes are exactly the same (write operation appears to be completely blocking)
	* Sequential reads take 38ns (3x 80MHz cycles)
	* Write and read (But not use data from read) takes 7x 80 MHz cycles.
	* Write, read, write (using data immediately) takes 12 cycles.
	* It appears using data immediately after read incurs a one 80 MHz cycle penalty.
	* W1TS and W1TC are the same as OUT.
	* See gpio_struct.h for the actual structure.
	* Interrupt servicing takes around 32 cycles (200ns) if you include all GPIO and bus overhead, when using bonded triggers.
	* Externally, tests have shown rising end to output being around 196 to 272ns (+/- 76ns). (p-p jitter of 12 160 MHz cycles)
	    * This is with AHB usage but not anything particularly heinous, like running directly from flash.

## I2S General observations:
	* When setting I2S to APLL it automatically operates at 240MHz.  You must /2 for BCK.  But that is, stock, 120 MHz output clock.
	* APLL Seems tied to BBPLL.  But BBPLL can't overclock too hard.  Part becomes flakey at 220/240 MHz.
	* I could only get TDM mode working, and only then without a properly formed WS line.  So it's good for fun stuff, not for real TDM.



## Get an assembly listing of your program.

Ideally you write some stub function to do what you want to do roughly, then run this, then write your own function to replace it in assembly.

```
riscv32-esp-elf-objdump -S build/hello-world.elf  > list.txt
```


## Rom dumping

```
esptool.py --baud 1500000 -p /dev/ttyUSB0 dump_mem 0x40000000 0x40000 esp32_c3_romdump.bin
riscv32-esp-elf-objdump -b binary --adjust-vma=0x40000000  esp32_c3_romdump.bin -m riscv:rv32 -D > esp32_c3_romdump.txt
```

Find your function in esp32c3.rom.ld and follow it around.

## I2S Engine

The I2S engine in the C3 looks to be much more robust than in previous chips.  I still can't get WSCLK working right, but the raw performance with the GDMA engine is spectacular.


## Interrupts

Interrupts are stored in `vectors.S` and use a jump table.  All interrupts are funneled through `_interrupt_handler` at this time, there is some unfortunate code in `interrupt_controller_hal.c`'s `is_interrupt_number_reserved(...)` which prevents attaching of interrupts which do not use `_interrupt_handler` within the rest of the system.

WAIT! Maybe this is a OK thing.  That means we might be able to arbitrarily assign interrupts. YES! Yes can.  Time for a PR.

So, figured it out. 
	(1) Looks like avoiding the `j` in the vector jumptable saves 2 (160 MHz) cycles.
	(2) That means for an external interrupt, to replying with GPIO back out with the following code, it takes 200ns, or 32 (160 MHz) cycles.

This slowness is unfortunate but understandable.  It also includes the time spent to increment the stack pointer, save off some registers, setup the regisers for GPIO output and output.


### TODO Interrupts

Can we weakly tie all of the interrupts to unique handlers then allow users to override if they want?









## TODO
 * Play with BBPLL to see if we can up the main clock frequency --> YES! It's very similar to the 8266.
 * Look into `esp32c3/rtc_clk.c` and up `rtc_clk_cpu_freq_mhz_to_config`

## Process for figuring out I2C and APLL

This describes a process which took place sfrom Sat Mar 27, 2021 at ~4:00 PM to Sunday at ~6:00 AM ET.

 * Look at https://github.com/cnlohr/esp32-cnlohr-demo/blob/master/main/i2s_stream_fast.c and make a system.
 * Ok, outputting MCLK.  Nothing else.  But Now, I'm curious about APLL.

 * Look around for APLL references.
 * Look at other devices for their APLL config code.
 * Find out I need to do something like this, but it's broken and causes ESP to reboot.
```
        REGI2C_WRITE_MASK(I2C_APLL, I2C_APLL_DSDM2, sdm2);
        REGI2C_WRITE_MASK(I2C_APLL, I2C_APLL_DSDM0, sdm0);
        REGI2C_WRITE_MASK(I2C_APLL, I2C_APLL_DSDM1, sdm1);
        REGI2C_WRITE(I2C_APLL, I2C_APLL_SDM_STOP, APLL_SDM_STOP_VAL_1);
        REGI2C_WRITE(I2C_APLL, I2C_APLL_SDM_STOP, APLL_SDM_STOP_VAL_2_REV1);
```
 * Other addresses don't reboot.
 * Let's explore the internal I2C.
 * `rom_i2c_readReg` crashes when trying to access what is in the headers as the APLL address.
 * Dump rom, let's figure out how it works.
 * Copy pertinent code into a new assembly function, just avoiding the crashy bits.
 * OK THAT WAS TOO COMPLICATED.
 * Try again
 * It doesn't crash this time for some reason.
 * Dump list of connected I2C devices.

 *  = fXtal * (24 + 31/256 + 15/65536 + 4 ) / 18 => fXTal = 153.62MHz? --- This APLL is different :(
 * Ok, looks like the APLL is in use.  Don't mess with it.
 * Try configuring MCLK on I2S to APLL
 * Find out it's APLL/2; currently outputting at 120 MHz.
 * Yes, it looks like the APLL is currently in use for something.  Maybe it can be tweaked?
 * Tweak SDM0 -- NADA! Nothing seems to get it to go.  Ok.  Give up on that for now.

OK GIVE UP ON APLL.

 * Just chug away at using the I2S engine.  Hopefully we can get the bitrate up.
 * HURRRRRRR It looks like some pretty major changes in the way the data is handled.  Need to do gdma.
 * Ok, dig around, a lot.  Find the SPI stuff with GDMA and try to piece it together.
 * Spend 5 hours poking at registers.
 * Get BCLK up.
 * It's really useful to force the clocks on to experiment.  Also TDM mode seems to make clock more when things are janky.
 * Rifle around til 6:06 AM.
 * Get it working at 120 Mbauds with apll


## Messing with the BBPLL

```
	rom_i2c_writeReg( 0x66, 0x00, 0x03, 0x09 ); //Sets system clock to 173.36 MHz.
```

Tested with my part, when in 160 MHz mode, 0x0c (213.4 MHz) is janky.  0x0d and 0x0b don't work. But 0x0a (186.6 MHz is great).

The next byte, 0x04 does seem to have some sort of other division effect.  Also, 0x02 as well.


It's 7:21 AM now, I found out that when you mess with the BBPLL (0x03->0x0c), it also affects the APLL, so I can test the APLL at 320MHz and it works.  (The system is still janky)

Rifling around in the DIG and on the unknown device 0x67 as well as the SAR ADC has yielded nothing.

8 AM now... Still no sign of the APLL.
